# KairanBotPython
IMPORTANT<br>
Unfortunately, this repo is being archived in the near future, until I can make changes to fix core issues. :(
<br> I will still list the bot as public and all features will remain the same. Sorry :(<br> This code still works so feel free to make improvments and make pull requests.<br>
I will invite you to a team so we can integrate changes.<br>
<pre><code>1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. git clone <a href="https://www.github.com/kairanaquazi/KairanbotPython.git">https://www.github.com/kairanaquazi/KairanbotPython.git</a> master
3. cd KairanBotPython
</pre></code>
<strong>Add your bot token into token.txt</strong><br>
<strong>Edit the praw.ini file.
Add your Reddit's bot id, secret and name. If you don't want to do Reddit
tools, delete the Reddit command in socialandstuff.py</strong>
<pre><code>
5. python bot.py
</pre></code>
You may also have to remove some of my guild specific code to make sure you don't get
errors.

Feel free to file issues (please don't email me unless it is an urgent issue, eg. Data leak)
